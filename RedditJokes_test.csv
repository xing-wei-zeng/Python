They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and back together again. The boy asked his father, ""What is this father?"" The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, ""Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is."" While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady limping slightly with a cane slowly walks up to the moving walls and pressed a button.

They continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction. The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman stepped out. The father said to his son, ""Go get your Mother.""",1
